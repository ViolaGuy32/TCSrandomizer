# TCSrandomizer  

Lag abuse and rates lower than 50 are not included in any logic setting.  
Casual logic does not include any glitches or advanced techniques, and does not require you to bring helmets between scenes.  
Glitched logic does not include Super Jumps, DV3 Skip, CCT Door Clip, manipulating enemies onto buttons, or bringing a helmet past a point in which you can no longer backtrack.

Demonstrations of most glitches and tricks included in logic can be found here: https://youtu.be/3Kbj7yWJr9E  
An updated video with all techniques will hopefully be released soon.
